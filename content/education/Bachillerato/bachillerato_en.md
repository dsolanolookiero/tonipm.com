- Research project:
  
    **Metal Games** was the first website I made, totally static and horrible ðŸ˜†; with a design from another dimension, skulls, black, red and white colors, without a doubt my best design to date ðŸ˜Ž. It simply contained news and information about the world of video games and Heavy Metal, passions that I still keep today.
    
    The work itself was not the web page, it was an addition to all the research of programming languages, methodologies and everything about web development at that time.
