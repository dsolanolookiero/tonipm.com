    Online multiplayer video game developed with **Unity**, more specifically a **MOBA**.
    A MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena), is a strategy game in which two teams with different players compete with each other with the aim of destroying the opponent's base. In these games the strategy to follow is teamwork. To destroy the enemy base, the team will have not only the players, also units controlled by artificial intelligence that are generated automatically.
