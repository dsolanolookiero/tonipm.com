I love learning new technologies and be up to date about what's new in the development world.</p><p>One of the things I like the most about programming is that it allows me to find solutions for everything, that's why I'm a big fan of scripting. If I have to do anything, I'm sure it can be automated with a script.</p><p>In constant learning and always listening music, today I'm studying cybersecurity, but I have a better time on the Frontend, which is the least I touch ðŸ˜Ÿ.</p><p>One day I would like to become a master of JavaScript, but it changes every year so it's hard to follow ðŸ˜‚</p><p> Always ready for new challenges that challenge me and make me break my head.</p> ",
