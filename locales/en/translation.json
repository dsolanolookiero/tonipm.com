I love learning new technologies and keeping up with what's new in the development world.</p><p>One of the things I like the most about programming is that it allows me to find solutions for everything, that's why I'm a big fan of the scripting. If I have to do anything, I'm sure it can be automated with a script.</p><p>In constant learning and with music always on, today I am specializing in cybersecurity, although the hours go by much more fast in the Frontend.</p><p>One day I would like to become a master of JavaScript, but as it changes every year it is difficult to keep up ðŸ˜‚</p><p>Always ready for new challenges.< /p>",
